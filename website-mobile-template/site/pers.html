		<p class='persbody'>Hey there I'm Kevin! As a third-year in the Graphic Communication department of California Polytechnic State University, I possess various background skills from my major classes that can help me to help you even better. I have very many knowledge points in digital file preparation, workflow and publishing, typography, color management, and the many applications of various printing technologies. In addition, I have some hands-on screen printed electronics experience through helping to print and assemble electronic greeting cards and I can even work a computer from time to time. Check out my professional page <span><a class='perslink' href='prof.html'>here.</a></span></p>
