		<h class='persinformations'>A brief introduction</h>
		<p class='persinformations'>Hey there I'm Kevin! As a third-year in the Graphic Communication department of California Polytechnic State University, I possess various background skills from my major classes that can help me to help you even better. I have very many knowledge points in digital file preparation, workflow and publishing, typography, color management, and the many applications of various printing technologies. In addition, I have some hands-on screen printed electronics experience through helping to print and assemble electronic greeting cards. I am also fluent in a few languages, programming and otherwise, so I can speak to most computers or people and serve as translator if necessary.</p>
